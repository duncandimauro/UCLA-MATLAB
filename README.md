This repository includes my homework/project solutions for MAE M20 (MATLAB Programming) taken during Fall 2019

The most notable projects are Homework 7 problem #2 and the Final Project:

Homework 7 problem #2 (Conway's "Game of Life")
  - Simulate the fate of living cells by plotting them on a grid, updating the visuals real-time for every generation run. Utilize the rules of Conway's Game of 
  Life - a white pixel = a living cell.

Final Project:
  - Utilize a genetic algorithm to find the optimal path for a 4-link robotic arm to follow, reaching a goal while avoiding static obstacles
